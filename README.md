# sidemenuSASS

- this is one of my previous projects that i tried to rebuld it with new
  dev tools i just learned to work with, such as :
  	- SASS
	- GULP task runner
- in this project i tried to implement standard 7-1 pattern for better
  mangement of SASS files.
- also i added BOOTSTRAP 5 to this project with npm package manager and
  learned how to modify BT styles using SASS
- from now on i will use this project template for my future web designs
  because with the use of some very helpful tools and extensions like GULP
  and SASS the development process will be a piece of cake!

- issues and problems i ran into during creating this template and
  project :
  1. it seems gulp-uglify has some problem minifing if/else statements
     of js/jQuery.
  2. jQuery not selector (:not) has some problems that wont work with
     two classes. (.class1:not(.class2))
