# sidemenuSASS

- this is one of the previous projects that I tried to rebuild with new
  dev tools I just learned to work with, such as :
  	- SASS
	- GULP task runner
- in this project, I tried to implement a standard 7-1 pattern for better
  mangement of SASS files.
- also I added BOOTSTRAP 5 to this project with npm package manager and
  learned how to modify BT styles using SASS
- from now on I will use this project template for my future web designs
  because with the use of some very helpful tools and extensions like GULP
  and SASS the development process will be a piece of cake!

- issues and problems I ran into during creating this template and
  project :
  1. it seems gulp-uglify has some problem minifying if/else statements of js/jQuery.
  2. jQuery not selector (:not) has some problems that won't work with two classes. (.class1:not(.class2))
